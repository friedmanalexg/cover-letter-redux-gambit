// I need to define an array that is populated with User.Blocks.all. I made need to add a user field to blocks, or find a way to render the blocks from User.Letters.all.
// I need to render each Block's "block_name" in a dropdown.
// When a user selects a block, render the BlockEditCard in a div below.

//Fetch notes... fetch the data for blocks and letters and feed them to the state store. Then use that copy instead of fetching. Send data back but copy it to state at the same time instead of doing more GET fetches.
// Fetch => Store => Map => Render => Modify => Store & Fetch:PATCH

//BEWARE... DELETE in Redux is extremely asanine https://youtu.be/bml92jhF4t8?t=2098
//how is it that obnoxious ðŸ¤£

//i can use "select" instead of input for form data
